***Description***
This is just another wifi handshake capture automation I am writing for educational purposes with a couple of really neat features. It requires apt and will look for and install, if needed, aircrack-ng. I am still adding files and tweaking scripts and changing things around as I see fit so it is in no way complete nor ready for use.

Since it is being built for educational purposes I will be updating it live and adding files as I work on it. So as I work on it you will be able to see everything, every funny little note and comment I make along the way.

Take it apart, use bits of my code if you like, play with it, learn with it. All I ask is you give me a little tag line of credit if you use it or any part of it inside something you create. I am creating this out of automation, laziness, and for learning personally. As a Pentestor I can see this may even be useful to other pentestors, instructors, or those just starting out in the field of cyber security. Please enjoy and I hope others too use this as a learning experience.
